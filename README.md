This GitHub Repo is for Composing Digital Media fall semester of 2021. Included in this repository is a screenshot of my final-for-now project on Audacity as well as a screenshot of a closer view of one of the audio clips I used with a fade in/fade out effect. This piece briefly describes the story of my two major surgeries and the most important lesson I learned from that experience. I worked with recordings of my own voice in addition to recordings of a heart mobnitor and hospital chatter from Freesound.com.
